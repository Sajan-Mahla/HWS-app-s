# 📱 HWS-app-s — SwiftUI App Projects

Welcome to my curated collection of apps built during the **Hacking with Swift (HWS)** journey.  
Every project here is **Mahla-engineered**, **Apple-targeted**, and **Swift-powered**. 🍏

## 🚀 Purpose of This Repo

This isn’t just a repo of practice projects.  
It’s a *live log* of my evolution as an iOS developer — one app at a time.

From foundational builds to future App Store-ready apps, this repo documents the grind from **Faridkot to Cupertino**.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Swift** — Core programming language  
- **SwiftUI & UIKit** — Used depending on project needs  
- **Xcode** — Primary development environment  
- **Git + GitHub** — For version control and documenting progress
