📱 HWS-app-s — SwiftUI App Projects

Welcome to my curated collection of apps built during the Hacking with Swift (HWS) journey.
Every project here is Mahla-engineered, Apple-targeted, and Swift-powered.

🚀 Purpose of This Repo

This isn’t just a repo of practice projects.
It’s a live log of my evolution as an iOS developer — one app at a time.

From foundational builds to future App Store-ready applications, this repo documents the grind from Faridkot to Cupertino.

🛠 Tech Stack

Swift — Core language
SwiftUI & UIKit — Depending on app needs
Xcode — Main development environment
Git + GitHub — Version control & project logs
📂 Apps in This Repository

1️⃣ TempMate (TempSm)
A SwiftUI temperature converter app that seamlessly converts Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin with real-time UI updates.
Features segmented pickers, state-driven logic, and input validation for smooth conversions.

2️⃣ WeSplit
A simple bill-splitting app using SwiftUI fundamentals — input, binding, and basic logic flow.
Built as part of the initial HWS lessons to master SwiftUI’s component structure.

📅 Roadmap

Add CalcMate multi-utility calculator (next Sunday build)
Upgrade QuoteMate to v2.0 (Apple ID login, categorized quotes)
Build real-world apps integrating APIs, Firestore, SwiftPM, and UIKit modules
🏆 Final Goal

All apps here are stepping stones toward my ultimate goal:

An Apple offer letter by June 16, 2026 — My Mom’s Birthday.
